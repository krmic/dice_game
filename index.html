          On a turn, a player rolls the dice repeatedly. Main goal is to
          accumulate as many points as possible. You can roll as many times as
          you want, and save your score by pressing the hold button, but if a
          player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and all points that he has
          accumulated during this turn are gone. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out
          your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during
          that particular roll. When a player reaches a total of 70 points, the
          game ends and that player is the winner.
